    """Wrapper for a Technique.

    An instance will try to return attributes from 'contents' if the attribute 
    is not found in the Step instance. 

    Args:
        name (str): designates the name of a class instance that is used for 
            internal referencing throughout sourdough. For example, if a 
            sourdough instance needs settings from a Configuration instance, 
            'name' should match the appropriate section name in a Configuration 
            instance. Defaults to None.
        contents (Technique): stored Technique instance used by the 'implement' 
            method.
        iterations (Union[int, str]): number of times the 'implement' method 
            should  be called. If 'iterations' is 'infinite', the 'implement' 
            method will continue indefinitely unless the method stops further 
            iteration. Defaults to 1.
        parameters (Mapping[Any, Any]]): parameters to be attached to 'contents' 
            when the 'implement' method is called. Defaults to an empty dict.
        parallel (ClassVar[bool]): indicates whether this Component design is
            meant to be at the end of a parallel workflow structure. Defaults to 
            True.
