class Parameters(sourdough.types.Lexicon):
    """Creates and stores parameters for a siMpLify component.
    
    Parameters allows parameters to be drawn from several different sources, 
    including those which only become apparent during execution of a siMpLify
    project.
    
    Parameters can be unpacked with '**', which will turn the 'contents' 
    attribute an ordinary set of kwargs. In this way, it can serve as a drop-in
    replacement for a dict that would ordinarily be used for accumulating 
    keyword arguments.
    
    If a siMpLify class uses a Parameters instance, the 'finalize' method should
    be called before that instance's 'implement' method in order for each of the
    parameter types to be incorporated.
    
    Args:
        name (str): designates the name of a class instance that is used for 
            internal referencing throughout siMpLify. For example, if a siMpLify 
            instance needs options from a Settings instance, 'name' should match 
            the appropriate section name in a Settings instance. Defaults to 
            None. 
        contents (Mapping[str, Any]): keyword parameters for use by a siMpLify
            classes' 'implement' method. The 'finalize' method should be called
            for 'contents' to be fully populated from all sources. Defaults to
            an empty dict.
        default (Mapping[str, Any]): default parameters to use if none are 
            provided through an argument or settings. 'default' will also be
            used if any parameters are listed in 'required', in which case the
            parameters will be drawn from 'default' if they are not otherwise
            provided. Defaults to an empty dict.
        runtime (Mapping[str, str]): parameters that can only be determined at
            runtime due to dynamic action of siMpLify. The keys should be the
            names of the parameters and the values should be attributes or items
            in 'contents' of 'project' passed to the 'finalize' method. Defaults
            to an emtpy dict.
        required (Sequence[str]): parameters that must be passed when the 
            'implement' method of a siMpLify class is called.
        selected (Sequence[str]): an exclusive list of parameters that are 
            allowed. If 'selected' is empty, all possible parameters are 
            allowed. However, if any are listed, all other parameters that are
            included are removed. This is can be useful when including 
            parameters in a Settings instance for an entire step, only some of
            which might apply to certain techniques. Defaults to an empty dict.
