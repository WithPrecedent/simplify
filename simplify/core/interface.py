class SimpleProject(quirks.SimpleBase, sourdough.Project):
    """Directs construction and execution of a data science project.
    
    Args:
        name (str): designates the name of a class instance that is used for 
            internal referencing throughout sourdough. For example, if a 
            sourdough instance needs settings from a SimpleSettings instance, 
            'name' should match the appropriate section name in a SimpleSettings 
            instance. Defaults to None. 
        settings (Union[SimpleSimpleSettings, Type[SimpleSimpleSettings], 
            pathlib.Path, str, Mapping[str, Mapping[str, Any]]]): a 
            Settings-compatible subclass or instance, a str or pathlib.Path 
            containing the file path where a file of a supported file type with
            settings for a SimpleSettings instance is located, or a 2-level 
            mapping containing settings. Defaults to the default SimpleSettings 
            instance.
        filer (Union[SimpleSimpleFiler, Type[SimpleSimpleFiler], pathlib.Path, 
            str]): a SimpleFiler-compatible class or a str or pathlib.Path 
            containing the full path of where the root folder should be located 
            for file input and output. A 'filer' must contain all file path and 
            import/export methods for use throughout sourdough. Defaults to the 
            default SimpleFiler instance. 
        identification (str): a unique identification name for a sourdough
            Project. The name is used for creating file folders related to the 
            project. If it is None, a str will be created from 'name' and the 
            date and time. Defaults to None.   
        outline (project.Stage): an outline of a project workflow derived from 
            'settings'. Defaults to None.
        workflow (project.Stage): a workflow of a project derived from 
            'outline'. Defaults to None.
        summary (project.Stage): a summary of a project execution derived from 
            'workflow'. Defaults to None.
        automatic (bool): whether to automatically advance 'worker' (True) or 
            whether the worker must be advanced manually (False). Defaults to 
            True.
        data (Any): any data object for the project to be applied. If it is
            None, an instance will still execute its workflow, but it won't
            apply it to any external data. Defaults to None.  
        states (ClassVar[Sequence[Union[str, project.Stage]]]): a list of Stages 
            or strings corresponding to keys in 'bases.stage.library'. Defaults 
            to a list containing 'outline', 'workflow', and 'summary'.
        validations (ClassVar[Sequence[str]]): a list of attributes that need 
            validating. Defaults to a list of attributes in the dataclass field.
    
    Attributes:
        bases (ClassVar[sourdough.types.Lexicon]): a class attribute containing
            a dictionary of base classes with libraries of subclasses of those 
            bases classes. Changing this attribute will entirely replace the 
            existing links between this instance and all other base classes.
